You can compile your code with `stack build` and/or once you have loaded ghci, you can load each module/file into the interpreter,

```
:l src/Filename.hs
-- Now you can run the functions in that module here
```

You can run the unit tests with `stack test` if you want to check your implementation. You can also look at the tests if the examples in the exercises are not clear.
