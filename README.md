================

Installation
------------
[Download the Haskell Platform](https://www.haskell.org/platform/) or [stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/install_and_upgrade/)

Usage
-----
In your terminal you can open the interpreter with `ghci` or `stack ghci`.

To compile a program, run `ghc Filename.hs` or `stack ghc Filename.hs`. This will create an executable in the current directory which you can run.

Core text
-----------
[Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!](http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters)

It is recommended a chapter a week is read and exercises completed. 

Exercises
---------

The exercises for the book are in the learnYouAHaskellExercises directory.

Once you have loaded ghci, you can load each module/file into the interpreter,

```
:l Filename.hs
-- Now you can run the functions in that module here
```

The exercises come in various degrees of difficulty, hopefully starting straightforward and then ramping up somewhat. If you try to run a exercises that you have not implemented yet, it will throw an error in the interpreter letting you know.

Feel free to contribute if they are too easy, too hard, or you have any suggestions.
